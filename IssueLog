    * Summary: nslib tests have undefined behavior and exit sometimes (particularly with nsvector ptr assignment with enough res?)
    * Solution: 


2021-10-14 Solved
    * Summary: string split and join sometimes cause extra string bits to be appended to final (not tested much, just noticed this while debugging something else)
    * Solution: string _Copy (used by _Construct_contents) did not add a string terminator

2021-10-10 Solved
    * Summary: both string and vector appending a single element cause crash when calling deallocate on _MY_PTR
    * Solution: Not really sure to be honest

2021-10-10 Solved
    * Summary: string::split and vector::join causes tons of undefined behavior
    * Solution: string::operator+=(const_reference) has issue (closing all issues caused by same problem and creating new)

2021-10-10 Solved
    * Summary: string::split() with causes segfault (in assembler.cpp)
    * Solution: string::operator+=(const_reference) has issue (closing all issues caused by same problem and creating new)

2021-10-10 Solved
    * Summary: vector's first element gets currupted sometimes (less than half the time, inconsistent)
    * Solution: problem with string::split calling string::operator+=(char) which did not increase the size of the string

2021-10-06 Solved
    * Summary: string::join() with vector<string> causes segfault (works other times) (in assembler.cpp)
    * Solution: string::operator+=(const_reference) has issue (closing all issues caused by same problem and creating new)

2021-10-03 Solved
    * Summary: assembler.DoAll() crashes program (gets crashes by vector<string>.append())
    * Solution: free statement in vector<T>.inceaseAlloc() was causing issues (undefined behavior, free seems unsafe, only caused issues in this project)

2021-10-02 Solved
    * Summary: GetFileContents crashes program
    * Solution: The string +=(char) function was being called inside, which had not been updated along with the other overloads meaning it was outdated and unstable
                string::operator+=(char) now allocates using malloc() and copies into strValue_ using vector<T>.toArray()

2021-10-02 Solved
    * Summary: Compiler::Compile() causes segfault
    * Solution: compile.PreProcecss returned uninitalized string (consider making string() initalize)

2021-10-01 Solved
    * Summary: nsstring join() somehow calls constructor on string and strValue_ is not initalized
    * Solution: uninitalized strValue_ is now default to nullptr
                stopped using free() (causing error)

2021-09-28 Solved
    * Summary: nsstring split() does not correctly create string objects
    * Solution: split() method now uses 'new' keyword

2021-09-28 Solved
    * Summary: nsstring incorrectly allocted memory with += operator
    * Soltuion: rewrote += operator to use malloc()

2021-09-22 Solved
    * Summary: segfault with nsio and nsstring when assigning strings
    * Solution: added copy constructor to nsstring
