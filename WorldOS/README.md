For developer details read ['docs/Design-dev.md'](docs/Design-dev.md).

## Precompiled Binaries

'bin/' contains 'disk.bin' which is a binary file that runs on a custom emulated CPU. This DOES NOT work with Qemu.

## Build Instructions

Make sure you have installed ECA. Look under ECA's README for more details.

Run `$ make` and this will create 'disk.bin'.
