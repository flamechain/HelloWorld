# Hello World Project

> Trello Board: [https://trello.com/b/IAZuAlru/helloworld](https://trello.com/b/IAZuAlru/helloworld)

> Made for Windows x64 ONLY

NOTICE: Most recent commit may not be stable. Once the first stable release is created, it will be added to github releases.

## Installing ECA

> This installer is NOT code signed, meaning it will prompt with admin confirmation because the publisher is unknown

You can run eca_setup.exe (in ECA/) to run the installer (generated by Inno). This will prompt you for an install location, where the folder ECA will be created (default C:/Program Files/ECA). Inside this folder will be standard libraries for all the supported languages, and the command-line build tools under bin/.
