Todo:

    * make repo for solution.py
    * fix nsstring::split crash

    * add strip method to string
    * add nslib map implementation
    * make ecc work with powershell and cmd instead of just bash
    * let nsstring handle format strings somehow
    * create first pass of assembler
    * add argument to CPU to specifiy file to treat as disk
    * add ECA argument to explicitly tell what the file is (G, Assembly)

    * fix -Wall and -Wextra warnings in nslib

    * consider adding docstrings to nslib methods, classes, and structs
    * consider moving negative indexing handler into xnsdef (e.g. size_t positiveindex(long long _Index)) because its the same as in vector and string (NSLib)
    * consider making _Char_traits and _String_traits structs instead of static classes (_Vector_traits as well)
    * consider adding private variables to _Traits class (nslib)
    * consider making a custom nslib allocator that uses custom heap
      then just swap in the new allocator (pro of having seperate allocator class, dependency injection)

Long Term:

    * finish assembler and compiler (C++ implementation)
        * assemble eas files
        * compile and assembler g files
        * link o files
    * create OS
        * threading (simulated, cpu is single-threaded)
        * fileio
        * basic terminal (MSDos similar)
        * assembler and compiler written in OS so you can compile programs and run them completely in OS
    * CPU
        * finish instruction set
        * finish gdt and idt architecture
