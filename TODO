Todo:

    * consider adding most string and vector pointer manipulation functions into seperate class to be used by both
    * consider putting traits of string and vector into _Traits class
    * finish inital bug fixing of nsstring and nsvector (so i can finally add features)
    * make ./make.exe local instead of in the repo
    * check if string::substring() should do _Substring[_End+1] = '\00' instead of _Substring[_End] = '\00'
    * finish assembler preprocessor (include statemetents)
    * create first pass of assembler
    * add argument to CPU to specifiy file to treat as disk
    * add ECA argument to explicitly tell what the file is (G, Assembly)

Long Term:

    * finish assembler and compiler (C++ implementation)
    * create OS
        * threading (simulated, cpu is single-threaded)
        * fileio
        * basic terminal (MSDos similar)
        * assembler and compiler written in OS so you can compile programs and run them completely in OS
    * CPU
        * finish instruction set
        * finish gdt and idt architecture
