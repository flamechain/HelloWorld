Todo:

    * finish rewrite of string and vector to use traits and make more sense (const util methods in traits class, use custom alloc (abstraction))

    * add strip method to string
    * add nslib map implementation
    * make ecc work with powershell and cmd instead of just bash
    * let nsstring handle format strings somehow
    * create first pass of assembler
    * add argument to CPU to specifiy file to treat as disk
    * add ECA argument to explicitly tell what the file is (G, Assembly)

    * consider seperating private data variables into a _Traits class
    * try making a custom nslib allocator that uses custom heap
      then just swap in the new allocator (pro of having seperate allocator class)

Long Term:

    * finish assembler and compiler (C++ implementation)
        * assemble eas files
        * compile and assembler g files
        * link o files
    * create OS
        * threading (simulated, cpu is single-threaded)
        * fileio
        * basic terminal (MSDos similar)
        * assembler and compiler written in OS so you can compile programs and run them completely in OS
    * CPU
        * finish instruction set
        * finish gdt and idt architecture
