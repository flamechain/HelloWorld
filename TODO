Sprint Goals:

    * Finish nsstring (with join, split, and strip) and nsvector
    * Finish assembler (with struct support)
    * Make G syntax

Todo:

    * fix nsstring::split crash

    * add nslib linked list implementation
    * add heap implementation to xnsmem0
    * add strip method to string
    * add nslib map implementation
    * make ecc work with powershell and cmd instead of just bash
    * let nsstring handle format strings somehow
    * create first pass of assembler
    * add argument to CPU to specifiy file to treat as disk
    * add ECA argument to explicitly tell what the file is (G, Assembly)

    * fix -Wall and -Wextra warnings in nslib

    * consider moving nslib into a seperate repo
    * consider adding print() to nsio with nsstring compatibility (nsio is currently just fio)
    * consider adding nslib to nstd namespace (to no conflict with std headers)
    * consider adding xml docstrings to nslib methods, classes, and structs
    * consider making _Char_traits a struct instead of a static class
    * consider adding private variables to _Traits class (nslib)

Long Term:

    * finish assembler and compiler (C++ implementation)
        * assemble eas files
        * compile and assembler g files
        * link o files
    * create OS
        * threading (simulated, cpu is single-threaded)
        * fileio
        * basic terminal (MSDos similar)
        * assembler and compiler written in OS so you can compile programs and run them completely in OS
    * CPU
        * finish instruction set
        * finish gdt and idt architecture
