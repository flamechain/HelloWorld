Lessons Learned:

    * free() is only used with malloc() pointers
    * delete is only used with new pointers
    * constructer only accounts for first initalization
      have to add operator= if you want to have object have the ability to reinitalize

Other Notes:

    * using another overload in itself (e.g. myFunc(int) uses myFunc(int, int)) seems like bad practice, but is useful
      may need to look further into best practices with overloads
