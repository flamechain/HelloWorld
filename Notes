Lessons Learned:

    * classes with templates are not template classes, but class templates
      * e.g. myclass is not a class or object, but myclass<int> is a class (still not an object)
    * free() is only used with malloc() pointers
    * delete is only used with new pointers
    * constructer only accounts for first initalization
      have to add operator= if you want to have object have the ability to reinitalize

Other Notes:

    * making files in 'old' folders have weird names / extensions so they aren't recongnized by github
    * using another overload in itself (e.g. myFunc(int) uses myFunc(int, int)) seems like bad practice, but is useful
      may need to look further into best practices with overloads
      * Not bad practice at all I found out
    * String is very similar to a Vector, very very similar (even uses same allocator)
      * Maybe think about having String be a subclass of Vector<char> (to allow better constructors)
    * Making every method const if possible. good practice?
