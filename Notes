Lessons Learned:

    * classes with templates are not template classes, but class templates
      e.g. myclass is not a class or object, but myclass<int> is a class (still not an object)

    * free() is only used with malloc() pointers

    * delete is only used with new pointers (delete[] and new[] as well)

    * constructer only accounts for first initalization
      have to add operator= if you want to have object have the ability to reinitalize
  
    * using another overload in itself (e.g. myFunc(int) uses myFunc(int, int)) is not bad practice

Other Notes:

    * string is very similar to a Vector, very very similar (even uses same allocator)

    * making every method and parameter const in possible (just prevents accidently modifying values you didn't want to change when writing the function declaration)
